		<p>In the most general sense, I love expressing myself. The term "ambivert" means I often alternate between being an introvert and an extrovert. Otherwise, I tend to be quiet and reserved depending on who I'm with.</p>

		<p>I often spend lots of time holed up in my personal space doing my own things; be it studying random things online, browsing stories or simply gaming.</p>

		<p>Public speaking is something I enjoy doing when necessary, because I enjoy the freedom of sharing what I think before an audience. I enjoy the thrill it brings. I joined an organization called "Toastmasters International" which is a collection of clubs dedicated to the betterment of one's public speaking capabilities, and I was recognized as one of the youngest members to obtain the title of "Competent Communicator" via completing the first 10 basic speech projects.</p>

		<h2>Golden rule: If you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you. :)</h2>

		<p>As for the subject, Iâ€™ve become somewhat accustomed to the challenges of back-end development for apps and projects, but I harbor an interest for front-end work. I enjoy the effort people put into aesthetics. Animations, designs, images, it all comes together to create a user experience that is both functional and attractive.</p>

		<p>I hope that this subject helps me see my potential to fine-tune my previous works and make them more visually appealing. I see this class giving me the other half I need to complete the circle with my projects and present them for future applications.</p>
