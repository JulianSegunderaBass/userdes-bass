			<p>From what I’ve understood so far, Need Finding is pretty much how it sounds, that is; finding a need that you may solve with innovation. Usually it involves a lot of brainstorming to come up with the design, framework and functionalities of your proposed solution, and possibly even more to identify what problem you’re gearing towards to begin with.</p>

			<p>In our group’s case, our idea came from somewhere near home in APC; the gaming community, specifically the Game Lab on the 5th floor. It’s a somewhat new development and has had its fair share of problems overtime.</p>

			<h1 align = "center">Introduction</h1>
			<p>As a simple introduction, our project is an online reservation system that allows the user(students and professors alike) to reserve a time slot to use a specific asset in the Game Lab. As an important note, according to a friend of ours who is a Game Development Professor, the lab is occasionally used for classes. Professors would have less time constraints when making a reservation for that purpose, and their classes would be given the upmost priority when using the lab. Students on the other hand would have a maximum window they may reserve, provided the equipment to be used is available, and that the period will not be over its capacity.</p>

			<p>Our aim with the system is to turn the lab’s noticeable issues into opportunities for improvement via our proposed system. The primary target areas would be the following:</p>

			
			<p>-The crowded numbers of students in the lab</p>
			<p>-Maintenance of the Lab’s assets(board/video games, consoles, etc.)</p>

		<h1 align = "center">Where it all began</h1>
		<p>One incident was a major influence in our decision for this project. This was when a student reportedly took away one of the games without permission and never returned it. We want our application to create a link between the users and the equipment for the sake of keeping better eyes on the lab’s assets, and to prevent incidents like these from recurring.</p>

		<p>You may be asking yourself, “why an online reservation system when a sign-up book already exists in the lab?” We believe the simple and honest answer would be two words; efficiency and accessibility. Why go all the way to the lab to see who is using what on a book when you can just access it online? We see the proposed system as a viable solution for the following reasons:</p>

	<div class = "content4">

		<h1 align = "center">The benefits!</h1>
		
		<p>-Reservations may be made in advance via a website rather than manually made on text.</p>
		<p>-It helps prioritize professors when they need the Lab for lectures and the such.</p>
		<p>-It allows the student heads/professors to monitor these reservations and equipment liabilities via the online viewing system.</p>
		<p>-A website or online application may open up opportunities for the use of color and iconography to symbolize the lab and its assets, making it more user-friendly.</p>
