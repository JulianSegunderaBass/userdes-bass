		<p>I believe this passage is primarily meant to invite a specific person to an event, while also confirming his/her attendance. </p>

		<p>I think it sounds a bit to plain in that it simply states the event, without adding more detailed descriptions. The spacing could be improved a whole lot to give more structure for the information.</p>

		<p>In terms of the information itself, I think it would be best to provide more, especially for the venue. It isn’t ideal for many people to have to follow up for information, so you would want to give all the details needed.</p>

		<p>Because it’s a party, it may also be a good idea to include a custom greeting for the receiver (Dear name) to make it a bit more personalized for friends and colleagues. </p>
