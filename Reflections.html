		<p>Our first week of classes were rather interesting for the most part, because we were introduced to a lot of new things. By new things, I mean tools that I’ve never really looked into, but probably should have, the main tool being Trello.</p>

		<p>I appreciate our professor taking the time to introduce us to these tools. They genuinely feel like real-world applications that can be taken beyond the academic framework. As a matter of fact, I see myself adopting Trello for many other projects after I graduate, or even those outside of work or academics. The other learning sites referred to us for the week were also very much appreciated, some of which where tools that fell out of my eye.</p>

		<p>In terms of our activities, they were challenging in a way that I found effective, especially the assignment involving the elevator design. I suppose I can say I was expecting something along those lines, but I underestimated its difficulty and found myself doing a lot more deep thinking, which is something that is definitely necessary in a course like this. Long story short, I think the assignments we’ve covered so far are very conducive to our cause.</p>

		<p>Moving from these technical points, the atmosphere is rather calming as well! I like how things can seem easygoing, yet stimulating to push ourselves with our work, which is how I would see an ideal class going. </p>

		<p>I suppose I underestimated the challenges that came with designing a brand-new app. The seemingly simple concept of brainstorming can be a lot more complicated than expected.</p>

		<p>I would think the concept of Need Finding is a necessity when it comes to these idea sprints, but one that’s also overlooked. I myself would sometimes fall victim to the overload of thoughts, ideas and extra frillings that I would forget about the core problem we were trying to solve, which is exactly why Need Finding is important; it creates an organized structure for your project to move forward while covering the necessary grounds.</p>

		<p>When working on our project, the Need Finding portion felt rather simple and direct in that we already recognized the main issue/s in our domain. The harder part came when designing the look and functionality of our app. One thing I’ve noticed is that you absolutely cannot be linear when you’re talking about design. Yes, you should stick to your goal but you have to create a design that flows like water, and can adapt to a variety of users. Not all may be able to read as well, so colors could be used. Then again, many are colorblind so iconography could be a thing. We try to think of creative new ways to navigate a site that work more than just a simple point-and-click method. </p>

		<p>After a lot of debating, our final design took some inspiration from Trello. The layout of a Trello board seemed like a suitable template to reference when creating our application, so hopefully with more tweaking a feasible model can be formed.</p>

		<img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/25/25231.svg" align = "left" id = "git">

		<p>I think this topic was the biggest revelation for me when it comes to Web Development. As I may have mentioned before, Web Dev has always been one of my greatest interests in programming. I find it much more immersive and attractive as, let’s say, Python or Java, primarily because it gives me more opportunities for styling.</p>

		<img src="Heroku.png" align = "right" id = "roku">

		<p>I love CSS, Bootstrap and HTML. There’s a good feeling when developing a list of pages that just seamlessly meld together to form the user experience. More than anything else I truly feel like I’m building something informative and responsive for myself and others.</p>


		<p>But my biggest issue has always been sharing my work. Of course, a website is nothing without the “web” aspect, and I’ve never really grasped the concept of purchasing and managing my own web domain. That being said, Github and Heroku’s integrated relationship is my first experience uploading one of my works to the cloud, and it’s a new exhilarating feeling for me. It almost feels like the last puzzle piece to the lesson; after building your art comes the endeavor of sharing it, and it’s made all the difference.</p>

		<p>First and foremost I loved the use of this website as a quiz, and I thought it was a clever take on getting the point through regarding the importance of UI Design; I certainly never saw it coming.</p>

		<p>I would say one of my current faults in UI Design would be focusing more on the beauty and fluidity of a page, that is, making things “look pretty” and transition more smoothly. While these obviously hold their own fraction of the site, it tends to distract me from focusing on the ethics and conventions when considering the user. A fancy scrolling function won’t do you any good if it slows down the overall movement.</p>

		<p>So if anything, as frustratingly amusing the quiz was, it did open my eyes as a strong reminder that efficiency, readability and clarity are of utmost importance when designing your project.</p>

				<p>The GDAP talk in MPH1</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>I suppose this SOCIT Fest was rather mellow compared to my previous experiences. Mostly on the side of seminars and guest speakers, with the exception of the gaming tournament in MPH1(which I was unable to attend, sadly). But needless to say the seminars were quite interesting.</p>

		<p>Not to throw shade on anyone, but seminars can have a tendency to get really draggy and tedious if not done right, but that wasn’t the case this week. I recall two talks I heard, one being the GDAP event, and the other being the seminar for Cognitive Services. </p>

		<p>Both talked about some interesting things that I could relate to very well; the gaming community, what makes a good game? How to market a good game, and how to tailor your product to your target audience.</p>

		<p>Mixed Reality is a particularly special topic for me, because it’s something I’ve experienced first-hand during my internship, so it was a lovely callback to see the potentials of technology growing today. The live demonstration of Microsoft Hololens was awesome, to say the least.</p>

		<br>

		<p>Moving on, I didn’t really have a specific role in the events, as I’m not part of an official “org”. I am however a Feature and Literary Writer for RAMpage, so if we end up writing something on any of the sessions, that would be my bid. Other than that, I helped by enjoying the event to its fullest.</p>

		<p>What I loved most would probably be the enthusiasm of the speakers. They were true professionals in their field who genuinely wanted to mentor the younger audiences, and I really saw that they love what they do. It was very inspiring. I hope next year’s events have the same vibe that we can all connect to and enjoy.</p>

		<p>The class itself was quite fun. It felt pretty stimulating to have all the design challenges, and I found out that Trello is definitely something I’ve been missing out on. It made me re-think how I should be looking at my interface designs, especially when it comes to stepping in a user’s shoes.</p>

		<p>At first I found it somewhat tedious that most of our activities were written, because I was expecting more regarding introductions to new software, but then I realized this is probably something meant more for our WEBPROG(Web Programming) subject. On the other hand, I absolutely love the introduction to Heroku, because I’ve always been looking for a way to upload my websites using a host. I can finally send them to friends and family as a somewhat full-fledged project.</p>

		<p>The biggest challenges would be the actual design of our project’s interface, mostly because I’ve never really done it before. Programming and focus on the inner workings of an app or website tend to also draw you away from the initial design impact you also have to reinforce, so it was a surprise to see that it was something quite foreign to me. Little things like placeholders, alerts, styles and navigation quickly became a big hurdle, but it was a fun challenge and I ended up learning a lot more via searching, even in CSS.</p>

		<p>The thing is, the biggest issue wasn’t even in the subject proper, but with one of our peers. I wouldn’t want to name him, but a member in our group didn’t do much, nor did he show up much to do anything either. I wish I could’ve understood his effort in the class. Maybe he had schedule issues like some of the irregular students(who also did a good job keeping up), but I really didn’t see much of an effort on his part, even with his other activities. I don’t want to throw any shade, but I just hope he’s happy with the grade he deserves.</p>

		<p>Improvements? Maybe we could delve a bit more into online, or even downloadable tools that could be used in our design that everyone could work with.</p>
